# School District Test Analysis with Pandas

## Project Overview
The school board has requested a summary of the standardized test scores from all the schools isn the district. Given the datasets schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv which contain data about each school's size and budget and each student at that schools reading and math grades, the task is to produce the following:

### District Summary

* Create a table showing a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics
 
### School Summary

* An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school

### Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate.

### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate.

### Math Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 


## Resources Used
- Data Sources: 
  - schools_complete.csv
  - students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Pandas 1.3.5, NumPy 1.20.3


## Challenge Overview
The school board has notified us that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Disiring to uphold state-testing standards this analysis was done by replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 

## Results
### Replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs

```python
# Step 2. Use the loc method on the student_data_df to select all the reading scores 
#from the 9th grade at Thomas High School and replace them with NaN.

student_data_df.loc[
    (student_data_df.school_name == "Thomas High School") 
    & (student_data_df.grade == "9th"),
    ["reading_score"] 
    ] = np.nan

student_data_df
```
### Deliverable #1 result


```python
#  Step 4. Check the student data for NaN's. 
nan_df = student_data_df.loc[
    (student_data_df.school_name == "Thomas High School") 
    & (student_data_df.grade == "9th")
]

## Deliverable 2 : Repeat the school district analysis

### District Summary

The total number of 9th grad students from Thomas High School is 461. The Total number of students is 39,170. This makes the new student count 38,709. Because the subtraction of the THS 9th graders is a small percentage of the total student count, the metrics at this level remain unaffected. No change was observed in the percentage of students passing math (74.8 %), passing reading (85.7%), and the overall passing rate (64.9%).
